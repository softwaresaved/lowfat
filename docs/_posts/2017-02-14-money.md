The amount of money left in your Fellowship pot is available on ["My Dashboard"]({{site.demo_site}}/dashboard/).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/claimant-dashboard-2023.png){: .img-fluid}

"Grant" refers to your initial Fellowship grant,
"Available" refers to your Fellowship grant not committed or spent,
"Committed" refers to the sum of approved funding requests' budget,
and "Spent" refers to the sum of all approved expenses claim.
If you sum "Available", "Committed" and "Spent" **during your inaugural year**
it should be equal to "Grant".
After your inaugural year,
"Available" will be £0 but you still can make a funding request.

Some funding requests and expenses,
e.g. in-person events such as the Fellows Inaugural Meeting and Collaborations Workshop,
will not be summed when computing "Available", "Committed" and "Spent" as the Institute funds these expenses separately.

## Example

At the beginning of the Fellowship,
a Fellow has £3000 available.

<figure>
<div class="money-bar-graph">
  <span style="width:100%" class="money-available">£3000</span>
</div>
</figure>

When a funding request of £750 is submitted,
£750 is reserved.

<figure>
<div class="money-bar-graph">
  <span style="width:25%" class="money-reserved">£750</span>
  <span style="width:75%" class="money-available">$2250</span>
</div>
</figure>

If the funding request is deleted by the Fellow
or rejected by the administrator,
the £750 is returned to the available portion of the grant.
If the funding request is approved,
the £750 stays reserved until the funding request is archived.

When the Fellow submits an expense claim of £600
and it is processed,
the £600 is marked as used
and the remaining £150 stays as reserved.

<div class="money-bar-graph">
  <span style="width:20%" class="money-used">£600</span>
  <span style="width:5%" class="money-reserved">£150</span>
  <span style="width:75%" class="money-available">£2250</span>
</div>
</figure>

When the funding request is archived by the administrator,
the £150 is returned to the available portion of the grant.

<div class="money-bar-graph">
  <span style="width:20%" class="money-used">£600</span>
  <span style="width:80%" class="money-available">£2400</span>
